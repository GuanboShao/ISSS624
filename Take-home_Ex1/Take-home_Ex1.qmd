## Overview

In this take-home exercise, with the purpose to address the issue of water supply in Nigeria, I will be using global and local measures of spatial Association techniques to reveal the spatial patterns of Non-functional water points in Nigeria.

## The Data

### Aspatial data

The aspatial data includes the water point data that can be downloaded from [WPdx+ Global Data Repository](https://data.waterpointdata.org/dataset/Water-Point-Data-Exchange-Plus-WPdx-/eqje-vguj/data). For this analysis, Shapefile data format is downloaded. The shapefile includes global water point data, the Nigeria water point data which will be used in our analysis is filtered in data importing section. The files' names are renamed to "geo_export" for easier use.

### Geospatial data

The geospatial data includes the Nigeria Level-2 Administratie Boundary (which is also known as Local Government Data LGA) polygon features GIS data which can be downloaded from [geoBoundaries](https://www.geoboundaries.org/). In "*Download geoBoundaries*" section, key in "Nigeria" to *Name*, and download the *ADM2 2020* data file. The files with name "geoBoundaries-NGA-ADM2" are used.

## Getting Started

In this exercise, the following R packages will be used:

-   [**sf**](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) for importing, managing, and processing geospatial data

-   [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) for importing, wrangling, and visualizing data

    -   [**tidyr**](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) for manipulating data

    -   [**dplyr**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) for transforming data

    -   [**ggplot2**](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) for visualizing data

-   [**tmap**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmap/vignettes/tmap-getstarted.html) for plotting cartographic quality choropleth map

-   [**spdep**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/spdep/spdep.pdf) for computing spatial weights, global and local spatial autocorrelation statistics

-   [**funModeling**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/funModeling/vignettes/funModeling_quickstart.html) for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The code chunk below installs and loads R packages into R environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse, tmap, spdep, funModeling)
```

## Importing the data into R environment

### Importing water point shapefile into R environment

The code chunk below uses [`st_read()`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sf/vignettes/sf2.html) of **sf** package to import water point data *geo_export* shapefile into R and save as simple feature data frame called *wp*.

[`st_transform()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/st_transform.html) of **sf** package is used to transform original geographic coordinate reference system (CRS) *WGS84* to *EPSG:26391 Minna/Nigeria West Belt*, which is more appropriate for our analysis.

[`filter()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html) of **dplyr** package is used to extract water point records of Nigeria.

```{r eval=FALSE}
wp <- st_read(dsn = "data/aspatial",
              layer = "geo_export") %>%
  st_transform(crs = 26391) %>%
  filter(clean_coun == "Nigeria")
```

The coordinates system has been changed to ESPG code 26391, which is Nigeria West Belt.

The code chunk below uses [`write_rds()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_rds.html) of **readr** package to save the extracted sf data table *wp* into rds data format file called *wp_nga* and is saved in *data* folder.

```{r eval=FALSE}
wp_nga <- write_rds(wp, "data/wp_nga.rds")
```

### Importing Nigeria LGA boundary data into R environment

Similar to importing water point shapefile, the geospatial data *geoBoundaries-NGA-ADM2* shapefile is imported into R and saved as simple feature data frame called *nga*.

```{r eval=FALSE}
nga <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial",
               layer = "geoBoundaries-NGA-ADM2") %>%
  st_transform(crs = 26391)
```

The code chunk below checks the CRS of *nga*.

```{r eval=FALSE}
st_crs(nga)
```

## Data Wrangling

### Recording NA values into string

The code chunk below uses [`replace_na()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/replace_na.html) to recode all NA values in *status_cle* field into *Unknown*.

[`mutate()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html) of **dplyr** package is used to derive new variables called *Unknown*.

```{r eval=FALSE}
wp_nga <- read_rds("data/wp_nga.rds") %>%
  mutate(status_cle =
replace_na(status_cle, "Unknown"))
```

### EDA

The code chunk below uses [`freq()`](https://rdrr.io/cran/summarytools/man/freq.html) of **funModeling** package to display the distribution of *status_cle* field in *wp_nga*.

```{r eval=FALSE}
freq(data = wp_nga,
     input = 'status_cle')
```

![](images/distribution%20of%20status.png){fig-align="center"}

According to the distribution diagram of each status, the proportion of functional water points includes *Functional*, *Functional but not in use*, and *Functional but needs repair*, which is **54.88%** in total. The proportion of non-functional water points includes *Non-Functional*, *Non-Functional due to dry season*, *Abandoned/Decommissioned*, *Abandoned*, and *Non functional due to dry season* which is **33.9%** in total.

## Extracting Water Point Data

In this section, I will use `filter()` to extract water point records by using classes in *status_cle* field.

### Extracting functional water point

The code chunk below uses `filter()` to select functional water points from *wp_nga* and name as *wp_functional*.

```{r eval=FALSE}
wp_functional <- wp_nga %>%
  filter(status_cle %in%
           c("Functional",
             "Functional but not in use",
             "Functional but needs repair"))
```

The code chunk below uses `freq()` to display the distribution of functional water points.

```{r eval=FALSE}
freq(data = wp_functional,
     input = 'status_cle')
```

### Extracting non-functional water point

The code chunk below uses `filter()` to select non-functional water points from *wp_nga* and name as *wp_nonfunctional*.

```{r eval=FALSE}
wp_nonfunctional <- wp_nga %>%
  filter(status_cle %in%
           c("Non-Functional",
             "Non-Functional due to dry season",
             "Abandoned/Decommissioned",
             "Abandoned",
             "Non functional due to dry season"))
```

The code chunk below uses `freq()` to display the distribution of non-functional water points.

```{r eval=FALSE}
freq(data = wp_nonfunctional,
     input = 'status_cle')
```

### Extracting water point with Unknown class

The code chunk below uses `filter()` to select Unknown water points from *wp_nga* and name as *wp_unknown*.

```{r eval=FALSE}
wp_unknown <- wp_nga %>%
  filter(status_cle %in%
           c("Unknown"))
```

The code chunk below uses `freq()` to display the distribution of unknown water points.

```{r eval=FALSE}
freq(data = wp_unknown,
     input = 'status_cle')
```

## Performing Point-in-Polygon Count

In this section, [`st_intersects()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/geos_binary_pred.html) of **sf** package to identify the water points located in each region of Nigeria, [`length()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/length) of **Base R** is used to calculate the number of water points in each region.

[`mutate()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html) of **dplyr** package is used to derive new variables namely *total wp*, *wp functional*, *wp non-functional*, and *wp unknown*.

```{r eval=FALSE}
nga_wp <- nga %>% 
  mutate(`total wp` = lengths(st_intersects(nga, wp_nga))) %>%
  mutate(`wp functional` = lengths(st_intersects(nga, wp_functional))) %>%
  mutate(`wp non-functional` = lengths(st_intersects(nga, wp_nonfunctional))) %>%
  mutate(`wp unknown` = lengths(st_intersects(nga, wp_unknown)))
```

## Saving the Analytical Data Table

The code chunk below uses `mutate()` to derive 2 fields namely *pct_functional* and *pct_non-functional*, which is the proportion of functional water points and non-functional water points in each region.

```{r eval=FALSE}
nga_wp <- nga_wp %>%
  mutate(pct_functional = `wp functional`/`total wp`) %>%
  mutate(`pct_non-functional` = `wp non-functional`/`total wp`)
```

The code chunk below uses [`write_rds()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_rds.html) of **readr** package to save the extracted sf data table nga\_*wp* into rds data format file called *wp_nga* and is saved in *data* folder.

```{r eval=FALSE}
write_rds(nga_wp, "data/wp_nga.rds")
```

Upon completing the above sections, we achieve an rds data format file called *wp_nga* which has a file size of 2.1MB. This allows us to keep a small size data file and delete raw data files which occupy space of several gigabytes. In the following section, wp_nga.rds will be used for analysis. A RMarkdown code [`{r eval=FALSE}`](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf) is used to skip evaluating previous code chunks and exclude their results so that the *wp_nga.rds* file will not be modified. If need to reproduce the previous sections, please change `{r eval=FALSE}` to `{r}` then proceed to run the code chunks.

## Visualizing the Spatial Distribution of Water Points

### Plotting thematic maps by using qtm()

[`qtm()`](https://search.r-project.org/CRAN/refmans/tmap/html/qtm.html) of **tmap** package provides a quick visualization of thematic map.

[`tmap_arrange()`](https://rdrr.io/cran/tmap/man/tmap_arrange.html) is used to create multiple stand-alone maps.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 14
#| fig-height: 12
nga_wp <- read_rds("data/wp_nga.rds")
total <- qtm(nga_wp, "total wp")
wp_functional <- qtm(nga_wp, "wp functional")
wp_nonfunctional <- qtm(nga_wp, "wp non-functional")
unknown <- qtm(nga_wp, "wp unknown")

tmap_arrange(total, wp_functional, wp_nonfunctional, unknown, asp = 1, ncol = 2)
```

### Plotting thematic maps by using tmap elements

[`tm_shape()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tmap/versions/3.3-3/topics/tm_shape) is used to define a spatial data object.

[`tm_fill()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tmap/versions/3.3-3/topics/tm_fill) is used to fill the polygons, a classification method is selected by *style* option. An equal map is obtained by setting *style = "equal"*, the number of categories *n* is set to 4. A quantile map is obtained by setting *style = "quantile"*, and *n = 4*.

[`tm_layout()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tmap/versions/3.3-3/topics/tm_layout) is used to customize the map layout, including title and legend.

[`tm_borders()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tmap/versions/0.7/topics/tm_borders) is used to define the borders of the polygons, *alpha* defines the transparency of line.

[`tmap_arrange()`](https://rdrr.io/cran/tmap/man/tmap_arrange.html) is used to create multiple stand-alone maps.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 14
#| fig-height: 12
map_equal <- tm_shape(nga_wp)+
  tm_fill(c("wp functional", "wp non-functional"),
          n = 4,
          style = "equal", 
          palette = "Blues") +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Distribution of Water Points \n(Equal classification)",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1.5,
            legend.height = 0.45, 
            legend.width = 0.35,
            legend.outside = FALSE,
            legend.position = c("right", "bottom"),
            frame = FALSE) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)

map_quantile <- tm_shape(nga_wp)+
  tm_fill(c("wp functional", "wp non-functional"),
          n = 4,
          style = "quantile", 
          palette = "Greens") +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Distribution of Water Points \n(Quantile classification)",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 1.5,
            legend.height = 0.45, 
            legend.width = 0.35,
            legend.outside = FALSE,
            legend.position = c("right", "bottom"),
            frame = FALSE) +
  tm_borders(alpha = 0.5)

tmap_arrange(map_equal, map_quantile, asp = 1, ncol = 2)
```

## Cluster and Outlier Analysis

### Computing contiguity spatial weights

[`poly2nb()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/poly2nb.html) of **spdep** package is used to compute contiguity weight matrices of Nigeria. This function with default setting *queen = TRUE* builds a neighbours list based on regions with contiguous boundaries.

```{r}
wm_q <- poly2nb(nga_wp, 
                queen = TRUE)
set.ZeroPolicyOption(TRUE)
summary(wm_q)
```

In Nigeria, there are 774 regions, the most connected region has 14 neighbors. There are 2 regions with only 1 neighbor.

### Row-standardized weights matrix

[`nb2listw()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/spdep/versions/1.2-7/topics/nb2listw) of **spdep** package is used to assign spatial weights to each polygon in neighbors list. *style* is set to *'W'* for row standardized option. *zero.policy* is set to TRUE to insert weights vectors of zero length for regions without neighbor in the neighbors list.

```{r}
rswm_q <- nb2listw(wm_q, 
                   style="W",
                   zero.policy = TRUE)
rswm_q
```

### Maron's I test

[`moran.test()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/moran.test.html) of **spdep** package is used to perform Moran's I statistics testing which measures the spatial autocorrelation and how one region is similar to its neighbors by standardizing the spatial autocovariance by the variance of data.

```{r}
moran.test(nga_wp$`wp non-functional`, 
           listw=rswm_q, 
           zero.policy = TRUE, 
           na.action=na.omit)
```

The p-value for non-functional water points is statistically significant, therefore the spatial distribution is more spatially clustered than would be expected if underlying spatial processes were random.

#### Computing Monte Carlo Moran's I

[`moran.mc()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/moran.mc.html) of **spdep** package is used to perform permutation test for Moran's I statistic. *nsim = 999* means 1000 simulations will be performed.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
bperm= moran.mc(nga_wp$`wp non-functional`, 
                listw=rswm_q, 
                nsim=999, 
                zero.policy = TRUE, 
                na.action=na.omit)
bperm
```

The Moran's I value is 0.43451, therefore we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that positive spatial autocorrelation is occurring.

#### Visualizing Monte Carlo Moran's I

[`hist()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.6.2/topics/hist) and [`abline()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.6.2/topics/abline) of **R Graphics** are used to plot the distribution of statistical values.

```{r}
hist(bperm$res, 
     freq=TRUE, 
     breaks=20, 
     xlab="Simulated Moran's I")
abline(v=0, 
       col="red") 
```

### Geary's C test

[`geary.test()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/geary.test.html) of **spdep** package is used to perform Geary's C test which measures spatial autocorrelation and determine whether adjacent similar observations are correlated by summing the square differences between pairs of data.

```{r}
geary.test(nga_wp$`wp non-functional`,
           listw=rswm_q)
```

The Geary's C test statistic is 0.6166737225 \< 1, therefore there is a positive spatial autocorrrelation and clustered.

#### Computing Monte Carlo Geary's C

[`geary.mc()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/geary.mc.html) of **spdep** package is used to perform permutation test for Geary's C statistic. *nsim = 999* means 1000 simulations will be performed.

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
bperm=geary.mc(nga_wp$`wp non-functional`, 
               listw=rswm_q, 
               nsim=999)
bperm
```

The Monte Carlo Geary's C test statistic shows same result as Geary's C test result which is 0.61667 \< 1, therefore there is a positive spatial autocorrrelation and clustered.

#### Visualizing Monte Carlo Geary's C

[`hist()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.6.2/topics/hist) and [`abline()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/graphics/versions/3.6.2/topics/abline) of **R Graphics** are used to plot the distribution of statistical values.

```{r}
hist(bperm$res, 
     freq=TRUE, 
     breaks=20, 
     xlab="Simulated Geary's C")
abline(v=1, 
       col="red") 
```

### Compute Moran's I correlogram

[`sp.correlogram()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/sp.correlogram.html) of **spdep** package is used to compute a 5-lag spatial correlogram of non-functional water points. The global spatial autocorrelation is set to Moran's I by *method = "I"*.

`plot()` of **base Graph** is used to plot the output.

```{r}
MI_corr <- sp.correlogram(wm_q, 
                          nga_wp$`wp non-functional`, 
                          order=5, 
                          method="I", 
                          style="W")
plot(MI_corr)
```

```{r}
print(MI_corr)
```

### Compute Geary's C correlogram

[`sp.correlogram()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/sp.correlogram.html) of **spdep** package is used to compute a 5-lag spatial correlogram of non-functional water points. The global spatial autocorrelation is set to Geary's C by *method = "C"*.

`plot()` of **base Graph** is used to plot the output.

```{r}
GC_corr <- sp.correlogram(wm_q, 
                          nga_wp$`wp non-functional`, 
                          order=5, 
                          method="C", 
                          style="W")
plot(GC_corr)
```

```{r}
print(GC_corr)
```

### Computing local Moran's I

[`order()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/order) is used to sort data according to a specified variable.

[`localmoran()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/localmoran.html) of **spdep** package is used to compute *Ii* values, given a set of *zi* values and a listw object providing neighbor weighting information.

```{r}
fips <- order(nga_wp$shapeName)
localMI <- localmoran(nga_wp$`wp non-functional`, rswm_q)
head(localMI)
```

In the output above, the columns are:

-   Ii: the local Moran's I statistics

-   E.Ii: the expectation of local moran statistic under the randomisation hypothesis

-   Var.Ii: the variance of local moran statistic under the randomisation hypothesis

-   Z.Ii:the standard deviate of local moran statistic

-   Pr(): the p-value of local moran statistic

[`printCoefmat()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/printCoefmat) is used to list the content of the local Moran matrix.

```{r}
printCoefmat(data.frame(
  localMI[fips,], 
  row.names = nga_wp$ID[fips]),
  check.names = FALSE)
```

### Mapping the local Moran's I values and p-values

[`cbind()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/cbind) of [**mice**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mice/mice.pdf) package is used to append the local Moran's I data frame *localMI* onto Nigeria SpatialPolygonDataFrame *nga_wp*. The output data frame is called *nga.localMI*.

[`tm_shape()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tmap/versions/3.3-3/topics/tm_shape) is used to define a spatial data object.

[`tm_fill()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tmap/versions/3.3-3/topics/tm_fill) is used to fill the polygons, a classification method is selected by *style* option.

[`tm_layout()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tmap/versions/3.3-3/topics/tm_layout) is used to customize the map layout, including title and legend.

[`tm_borders()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/tmap/versions/0.7/topics/tm_borders) is used to define the borders of the polygons, *alpha* defines the transparency of line.

[`tmap_arrange()`](https://rdrr.io/cran/tmap/man/tmap_arrange.html) is used to create multiple stand-alone maps.

```{r}

## Visualizing the Hot Spot Area of Water Points

The hot spot refers to a region that is higher relative to its surroundings. In this analysis, Getis and Ord's G-statistics is used to detect spatial anomalies, statistically significant hot-spots are recognised as areas of high values where other areas within a neighbourhood range also share high values too.

### Deriving the centroid

[`map_dbl()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/purrr/versions/0.3.5/topics/map) of [**purrr**](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) package is used to return double vectors, which have numbers that can have decimals. The mapping function applies a given function to each element of a vector and returns a vector of the same length.

[`st_centroid()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/geos_unary.html) of **sf** package is used to take polygons and return the point that is in the center of the geometry's envelope. The centroid point is halfway between the geometry's minimum and maximum x and y extents. To access longitude and latitude value, double bracket notation \[\[\]\] with 1 and 2 get the first and second value in *geometry* column of *nga_wp*.

[`cbind()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/cbind) of [**mice**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mice/mice.pdf) package is used to append longitude and latitude together.

```{r}
longitude <- map_dbl(nga_wp$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[1]])
latitude <- map_dbl(nga_wp$geometry, ~st_centroid(.x)[[2]])
coords <- cbind(longitude, latitude)
```

### Determining the cut-off distance

Steps to determine upper limit for distance band:

-   Return a matrix with the indices of points using [`knearneigh()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/knearneigh.html).

-   Convert the knn object into a neighbors list of class nb with a list of integer vectors using [`knn2nb()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/knn2nb.html).

-   Return the length of neighbor relationship edges using [`nbdists()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/nbdists.html).

-   Remove the list structure using [`unlist()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/unlist).

```{r}
k1 <- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords))
k1dists <- unlist(nbdists(k1, coords, longlat = FALSE))
summary(k1dists)
```

The output shows the largest first nearest neighbor distance is 72139, so this is the upper threshold.

### Computing fixed distance weight matrix

[`dnearneigh()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/dnearneigh.html) of **spdep** package is used to compute the distance weight matrix. For fixed distance weight matrix, more densely settled areas (usually the urban areas) tend to have more neighbors and the less densely settled areas (usually the rural areas) tend to have less neighbors.

[`nb2listw()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/spdep/versions/1.2-7/topics/nb2listw) of **spdep** package is used to assign spatial weights to each polygon in neighbors list.

The output spatial weights object is called *wm72139_lw*. There are 5 regions with only 1 neighbor, and the region with most neighbors has 70 neighbors.

```{r}
wm_d72139 <- dnearneigh(coords, 0, 72139, longlat = FALSE)
wm72139_lw <- nb2listw(wm_d72139, style = 'B')
summary(wm72139_lw)
```

### Computing adaptive distance weight matrix

For adaptive distance weight matrix, k-nearest neighbors is used to control the number of neighbors.

[`knearneigh()`](https://r-spatial.github.io/spdep/reference/knearneigh.html) of **spdep** package is used to return a matrix with the indices of points belonging to the set of the k nearest neighbors of each other.

[`nb2listw()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/spdep/versions/1.2-7/topics/nb2listw) of **spdep** package is used to assign spatial weights to each polygon in neighbors list.

```{r}
knn <- knn2nb(knearneigh(coords, k=71))
knn
```

```{r}
knn_lw <- nb2listw(knn, style = 'B')
summary(knn_lw)
```

### Computing Gi statistics with fixed distance weights

`localG()` is used to return vector of G or Gstar values.

The Gi statistics called *gi.fixed* is represented as a Z-score. Greater values represent a greater intensity of clustering and the direction (positive or negative) indicates high or low clusters.

`as.matrix()` is used to convert output vector into r matrix object.

`cbind()` is used to join *nga_wp* data and *gi.fixed* matrix to produce a spatial polygon data frame called *nga.gi*.

`rename()` is used to change the field name of Gi values to *gstat_fixed*.

```{r}
fips <- order(nga_wp$shapeName)
gi.fixed <- localG(nga_wp$`wp non-functional`, wm72139_lw)
nga.gi <- cbind(nga_wp, as.matrix(gi.fixed)) %>%
  rename(gstat_fixed = as.matrix.gi.fixed.)
```

fips <- order(nga_wp$shapeName)
gi.adaptive <- localG(nga_wp$`wp non-functional`, knn_lw)
nga.gi <- cbind(nga_wp, as.matrix(gi.adaptive)) %>%
  rename(gstat_adaptive = as.matrix.gi.adaptive.)
